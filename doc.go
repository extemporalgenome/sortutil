// Package sortutil provides utility functions for generically performing
// operations on implementors of sort.Interface, such as reversing or
// shuffling elements. It also provides tools to aid in designing and debugging
// sorting algorithms that are API-compatible with sort.Sort. Analyze provides
// a zero-setup method of quickly verifying the correctness and observing the
// behavior of sorting algorithms.
