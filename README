seq.go contains functions useful for generically manipulating sort.Interface
implementations. These functions are Reverse, Rotate, Skew, and Shuffle. Skew
in particular may be useful for prototyping algorithms that shift a block of
sorted data together. Skew uses the minimum number of Swap calls to complete
the shift, and emphasizes data-locality, so it should be reasonably
cache-friendly even when migrating small blocks across a great distance.

containers.go and wrappers.go have types and functions useful for designing,
debugging, and analyzing the behavior of sorting algorithms compatible with
the stdlib sort package.
